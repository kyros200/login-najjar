# login-najjar
authorization test system for my future projects.

## Project Versions
***2020-12-14 V0.0*** -> Initial version. It can Login and check token

***2020-12-15 V0.5*** -> fixed minor things, added front example.

## Context
**Every** idea that I have I always struggle with Authorization System. With this barebones project I intend to use it when I'll make some new projects (personal or freelance)

**It needs MySQL.** I'll leave an easy SQL script for the only necessary table.

## Installation (login-najjar)
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Installation (example-login-najjar)
Inside root folder, there is the `/example-login-najjar` folder. Inside there just:

*(if you dont have yarn, please type* `npm install -g yarn` *beforehand)*

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then go to `localhost:3000`

## Conclusion
I hope that someday I'll help someone with this project. My objective here is to comment every meaningful action to show **what** and **why** I'm doing this.

### TODOs
* Write a proper README.md
* Add style to `example-login-najjar`
* Comment project, both `login-najjar` and `example-login-najjar`
* Check `login-najjar` to be more generic
